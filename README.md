# Snake-Game

This is a simple snake game written in Python using the turtle module. The game is controlled using the w, a, s, and d keys to move the snake up, left, down, and right, respectively. The goal of the game is to eat as many food items as possible without hitting the walls or the snake's own body.

To play the game, simply run the snake.py file. The game will start with the snake in the center of the screen and a single food item placed randomly on the screen. The snake will start moving to the right. You can use the w, a, s, and d keys to change the direction of the snake. If the snake eats a food item, its length will increase by one and the food item will be respawned in a random location. If the snake hits the walls or its own body, the game will end.

The game has two difficulty levels: easy and hard. On easy mode, the snake moves slower and the food items are respawned more frequently. On hard mode, the snake moves faster and the food items are respawned less frequently. You can change the difficulty level by editing the difficulty variable in the snake.py file.

The game also has a high score system. The high score is displayed at the top of the screen. If you beat your high score, the game will congratulate you and update the high score.

Tips:

Try to keep the snake moving in a straight line as much as possible. This will make it easier to avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body.
If you're having trouble eating a food item, try to circle around it until you can get it in your mouth.
Be careful when the snake gets long. It's easy to hit yourself if you're not careful.
